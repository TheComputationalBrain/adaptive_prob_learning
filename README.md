# adaptive_prob_learning

This repository provide all code used to generate plots and results of the manuscript "Sophistication of Human Adaptive Probability Learning‬
‭ in Dynamic Environments".

The data folder contains the three datasets we used for the model comparison.

The models folder contains code to implement all models described in the manuscript.

The figures folder contains figures in the paper and all figures can be genenerate using the plots script. 

The analysis script contains all code we used to generate the results, including optimisation of parameters, cross-validation and model recovery. Running the script will take times. The results is already included in the results folder.
